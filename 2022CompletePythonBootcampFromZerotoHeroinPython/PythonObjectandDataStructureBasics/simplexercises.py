#Write an expression that equals 100. 

#For example 50+50   or 110-10 . 

#See if you can use more than one arithmetic operator! Write only one expression and submit only one line of code.

#If your expression results in 100, then you should see a success message after you test out your solution :)

x=100-0
print(x)

#Hi,

#Later on we will have more in depth tests that will involve you downloading a .ipynb notebook file and answering the questions in it. For now, let's have a quick check in to make sure everything is working so far. This should be a very simple problem for you.

#Your Task:

#Use what you know about the print() function to print out the phrase "Hello World" . Make sure your capitalization and spacing match.

print("Hello World")
##############################################################
#Write a string index that returns just the letter 'r'  from 'Hello World' .

#For example, 'Hello World'[0]  returns 'H'

#You should only write one line of code for this. Do not assign a variable name to the string.
print('Hello World'[-3])
##############################################################
#Use string slicing to grab the word 'ink'  from inside 'tinker'

#For example, 'education'[3:6]  returns 'cat'

#Remember that when slicing you only go up to but not including the end index.

#You should only write one line of code for this. Do not assign a variable name to the string.
print('tinker'[1:4])
